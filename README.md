## ⚙️ Challenge: 
- Learning Through the Looking Glass

## ⚙️ What works:
- Summary of some space telescopes.
- Game that represents what the human eye would see when seeing astronomical phenomena.
- Trivia where an image is presented, provides a brief explanation of it and the user must find out which telescope took it.
- It is an application that works online and offline, based on PWA technology. For each correct answer the player accumulates points that are presented in a scoring section.

## ⚙️ How much can develop with more time in the future:
- A more advanced game could involve an app that simulates images using the NASA-provided WebbPSF tool.
- Other games of different difficulty level.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used:
- JavaScript
- Reactjs
- PWA
- Images from space agencies
