- Learning Through the Looking Glass

## ‚öôÔ∏è What works:
- Summary of some space telescopes.
- Game that represents what the human eye would see when seeing astronomical phenomena.
- Trivia where an image is presented, provides a brief explanation of it and the user must find out which telescope took it.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How much can develop with more time in the future:
- Make configurations in the design to make it more responsive.
- A more advanced game could involve an app that simulates images using the NASA-provided WebbPSF tool.
- Other games of different difficulty level.
